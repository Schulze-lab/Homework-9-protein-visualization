# Assignments Week 9
# Introduction
The goal of this assignment is to visualize a protein and its interaction partner using ChimeraX. This will ideally help you to get more familiar with databases for protein structures, different modes of visualizing protein structures, differences between the levels of structures, and with interactions between proteins and other molecules.
# Input data
You can use any in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) as your starting point, since ChimeraX can directly fetch protein structures from PDB. You can use the search function on the PDB website to identify a structure that you want to work with (e.g. a receptor-ligand interaction, or a DNA-binding protein, or a protein-protein interaction).
# Tasks and output files
1)	Open a PDB protein structure in ChimeraX.
2)	Highlight a type of secondary structure (α-helix or β-sheet), e.g. using a different color, or zoomed in view.
3)	Show the hydrogen bonds for your selected secondary structure.
4)	Focus on the interaction between your selected protein and its interaction partner. Use at least two of the following characteristics to visualize the interaction:
a)	H-bonds
b)	Hydrophobicity
c)	Charge
5)	Use a script (e.g. Python) that can be executed within ChimeraX to solve these tasks. Make sure to comment your code, so that others can read and understand it easily. 
6)	Commit all your scripts, and results to your GitHub Classroom repository.
# Submission
You must submit the assignment through GitHub Classroom by 8 am Mar 30 to get full credit. 
# Bonus Credit
7)	Use ChimeraX to create a video that illustrates changes in a protein’s structure upon binding its interaction partner, e.g. the transition between a bound and unbound state.
