# Assignments Week 9
# Introduction
The goal of this assignment is to become familiar with visualizing protein structures using ChimeraX. This will ideally help you to get more familiar with the Protein Data Bank, a databases for protein structures, as well as different modes of visualizing protein structures, differences between the levels of structures, and with interactions between proteins and/or their ligands.
# Input data
You can use any protein structure in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) as your starting point, since ChimeraX can directly fetch protein structures from PDB. You can use the search function on the PDB website to identify a structure that you want to work with. Ideally, select a structure that allows you to visualize e.g. a receptor-ligand interaction, or the DNA binding of a protein, or a protein-protein interaction.
# Tasks and output files
1)	Open a PDB protein structure in ChimeraX.
2)	Highlight a type of secondary structure (α-helix or β-sheet), e.g. using a different color, or zoomed in view.
3)	Show the hydrogen bonds for your selected secondary structure.
4)	Focus on the interaction between your selected protein and its interaction partner. Use at least two of the following characteristics to visualize the interaction:
a.	H-bonds
b.	Hydrophobicity
c.	Charge
5)	Use a script (e.g. Python) that can be executed within ChimeraX to solve these tasks. Make sure to comment your code, so that others can read and understand it easily. 
6)	Commit all your scripts, and results to your GitHub Classroom repository.
# Additional MS student tasks (bonus credit for BS students)
7)	Use ChimeraX to create a video that illustrates changes in a protein’s structure, e.g. upon binding a ligand or interaction partner.
# Submission
You must submit the assignment through GitHub Classroom (or MyCourses) by 8 am Mar 28 to get full credit.
